# lowercase-able css

## Everything [4.1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#syntax)
**All CSS is case insensitive**, except for parts that reference values outside of the CSS — therefore this list of lowercase-able code will differ from the html, js, and svg versions.

- It will only require citations when the reference is outside the CSS scope.
- It will concentrate primarily on commonly uppercased parts.

## Hex colors

```css
* {
    color:#ABCDEF
}
```

```css
* {
    color:#abcdef
}
```
