# Examples of lowercase-able HTML code

## Doctype [13.1.1](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype)

Doctype is case insensitive.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

```html
<!doctype html>
```

### Additional optimization

The HTML Standard requires **zero** or more ascii whitespace between between `doctype` and `html` meaning the space can be ommitted.

```html
<!doctypehtml>
```
